Kata for Root Insurance
4/23/2018

This is a short program designed to read a list of drivers and a record of each of their trips (with a start time, end time, and miles driven) from an input file, and write a line for each driver to an output file, with the driver's total miles driven and average speed, arranged by each driver's total miles (highest to lowest).
